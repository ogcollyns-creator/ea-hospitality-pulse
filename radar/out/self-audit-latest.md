## Actions
- **source coverage** (FAIL): Give each blind tier-1 source an RSS/feed URL or frag selector; validate on the runner.
- **source staleness** (FAIL): Confirm the source still publishes; fix URL if it moved.
- **edition cadence** (FAIL): Confirm the scheduled Pulse task fired for each slot.
- **ledger hygiene** (FAIL): Resolve overdue calls now: P097. 
- **data freshness** (WARN): Re-verify each dataset's values and bump its 'updated:' field, or note it in-edition.
- **rate-index integrity** (WARN): Index still thin — never quote a median where n<3 or confident:false. Enforced in copy.
